This is a project I'm doing for my AI BSc.
The goal is to build a liver analysis system using a deep convolution neural network,
but right now I'm just testing some basic CNN in TensorFlow, and checking if everything
works with Git.

As the project proceeds, I'll add more information and improve the system.

Future plans right now include adding a personal log file; adding TensorBoard
visualizations; and improving the system organization and code in general.
