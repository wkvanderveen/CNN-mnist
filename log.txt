	Started working on the system. To build a full-fledged liver analysis DCNN, I figured I'd best begin making an operable MNIST CNN, with things like graph visualizations and loss plots included. Once that works, I'll study the code, improve it where possible, and swap the MNIST data for the liver data.

	Got TensorBoard to work, and installed TensorFlow on my home GPU. That way, I can train the system much faster. Reminder for next time: use the most up-to-date install guide on the TensorFlow website. CUDA 9.0, CuDNN 7.

Mon Feb 12:
    Implemented a visualization for the convolutional layer weights and outputs.

Wed Feb 14:
    Modified system structure. No longer config.py as main file, but cnn_mnist.py. Makes it easier to change hyperparameters.
    Fixed an error where the convolution layer 2 weights and outputs plots would not show all channels.
