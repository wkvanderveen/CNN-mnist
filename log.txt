	Started working on the system. To build a full-fledged liver analysis DCNN, I figured I'd best begin making an operable MNIST CNN, with things like graph visualizations and loss plots included. Once that works, I'll study the code, improve it where possible, and swap the MNIST data for the liver data.

Fri Feb 09:
	Got TensorBoard to work, and installed TensorFlow on my home GPU. That way, I can train the system much faster. Reminder for next time: use the most up-to-date install guide on the TensorFlow website. CUDA 9.0, CuDNN 7.

Mon Feb 12:
    Implemented a visualization for the convolutional layer weights and
    outputs.

Wed Feb 14:
    Modified system structure. No longer config.py as main file, but cnn_mnist.py. Makes it easier to change hyperparameters.
    Fixed an error where the convolution layer 2 weights and outputs plots
    would not show all channels.

Thu Feb 15:
    Merged weight and output plotting in one function.
    Cleaned up and commented code.

Fri Feb 16:
    For the time being, I will not be updating this repo any further. Instead,
    I will work on the actual network. It's not going to be a DCNN but an RNN.
    The current version of this MNIST CNN can be considered the final version,
    and should work as a simple standalone version.
